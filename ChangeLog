    * mysql.c: updated mysql.c Ns_MySQL_BindRow() and Ns_MySQL_Select()
    to include the table name as part of the key of the ns_set resultset.

    * mysql.c: updated mysql.c with new [ns_mysql include_tablenames] feature

    * README: updated README about libz and pointed FAQ at the wiki

    * Makefile: updated Makefile with stuff about maybe needing -lz for libz

	* mysql.c:
	MSVC++ didn't appreciate "unsigned long long", so I #ifdef WIN32
	and use "unsigned __int64" which it likes.

	* win32/README, win32/nsmysql.dsp, win32/nsmysql.dsw: New file.

	* README: Minor updates for v0.4.

	* mysql.c: added [ns_mysql resultrows] which returns the number of rows
	affected by the previous query.

	Fixed the bug in Ns_MySQL_Exec() where mysql_store_result()
	returns NULL, but the query did not error (as is in the case
	of some DML statements).  I thought this was fixed in v0.3,
	but I still didn't get it right.  (Thanks to Thomas Park
	<thomas@sombasa.com> for the bug report and patches.)

	* mysql.c:
	Added mysql_field_count() check in Ns_MySQL_Exec() for the special
	case where mysql_store_result() returns NULL (no rows returned) but
	it is not an error (in the case of DML).
	(Thanks to Midh Mulpuri <midh@PURDUE.EDU> for this bug report and fix.)

	Big fix:  Use of Ns_MutexLock() and Ns_MutexUnlock() to make the driver
	thread-safe.  Also, moved calling of mysql_init() to the right place
	and now call it in a thread-safe manner as well.
	(Thanks to Jack Hong <hong@staff.sina.com> for this bug report and
	testing assistance.)

	* mysql.c:
	mysql_num_fields() was being passed handle->connection incorrectly,
	should have been the MYSQL_RES structure.

	snprintf() replaced with sprintf() for win32 compatibility

	* Makefile: New Makefile convention for AOLserver 3.0rc1.

2000-03-20  Dossy  <dossy@panoptic.com>

	* Makefile, makefile: MYSQL_PREFIX/_LIBDIR/_INCDIR changes
	obsoleted $srcdir/third directory structure

	* Makefile, makefile, README: New file.

2000-01-20  Dossy  <dossy@panoptic.com>

	* mysql.c: Revised makefile to no longer use $(THIRD) directory,
	instead, MYSQL_PREFIX needs to be set in makefile.
	Added ns_mysql commands: list_dbs, list_tables, select_db.

2000-01-13  Dossy  <dossy@panoptic.com>

	* mysql.c: Initial revision.  Basic functionality implemented, with
	minimal testing performed.
