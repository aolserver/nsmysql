1.  What is this?

This is the Win32 port of the Panoptic AOLserver MySQL driver.
It has been successfully compiled and tested under:

- AOLserver 3.0 RC1, MySQL 3.22.30, under Windows 98.
- AOLserver 3.0, MySQL 3.22.30, under Windows 98.
- AOLserver 3.3.0, MySQL 3.23.34a, under Windows 98 SE.

The tests were done using AOLserver on Windows 98 SE
connecting to a MySQL database running under Linux using the
winclients-3.23.14 MySQL 3.23.14 Win32 client binaries.

2.  Who is responsible?

Well, I guess since I put this together, I'm mostly responsible.
If it doesn't work, try not to blame me, and instead submit
patches.  :-)

5.  Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).

The FAQ is maintained on the AOLserver Wiki at:

Q:  I get this strange "win32 error code: 1157" error in my server.log.
    What does it mean?

A:  You're seeing something like this in your server log:

   Notice: loading: x:/path/to/aolserver/bin/nsmysql.so
   Warning: could not load x:/path/to/aolsever/bin/nsmysql.so:  win32 error code: 1157
   Error: nsd.db: could not load driver: mysql

Chances are, this means you didn't copy the libmySQL.dll into your
aolserver/bin directory.  This is LoadLibrary()'s way of saying that
there were unresolved symbols when trying to dynamically load
nsmysql.so, which is a DLL.  nsmysql.so is linked against libmySQL.dll,
therefore it too needs to be loadable, and the easiest way to do this
is to stick it in the aolserver/bin directory.
